### GAME NEWS V1 ###

The app about game news built to train myself as IOS developer :)

### Tech ###
It uses the igdb.com API (v3) to fetch the news.

Was built using swift, with the following libraries:

* Alamofire - to fetch the data
* AlamofireImage - to do image transformations
* SwiftyJSON - to made the life easier to decode the json from the api
* RealmSwift - to be used in the future to store the favorite news

### How to use ###

For the app to work: 

1 - You have to get a key from igdb.com website.
2 - Paste the key in the GameNews/keys.plist file in the IGDB_KEY field value
